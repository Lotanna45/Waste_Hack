A web application addressing the problem of waste Management.

The name of our web application is Waste Hack. Its aim is to provide resources and educate the user about the issue of waste management. We believe that it is important to identify knowledge and bridge those gaps through resource sharing. This is exactly what our website does.

Our web application has an “Importance” page that communicates to the user the importance of waste management in our current society. We used a python script to convert the csv data from the US Environmental Protection Agency into an image. We also utilized Power BI in this process. 
 
There is also an “Community Engagement” page where upon landing on the page, the user can respond to the posts of other community members by clicking on the “response” button. After which a modal will pop-up showing a thank you message. The user can also create a post by filling out the form at the bottom of the page. This post will be added to the previous posts in the community. If one of the boxes is empty, then the form will not be submitted. 
 
We have also included another page titled “Quiz”. In this section the HTML code presents an interactive quiz format where the user is given an image of an item and asked if that item is recyclable or not. The user will then have to select the ‘yes’ or ‘no’ radio button accordingly. Once the user has selected a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ radio button for each question they can then click the submit button. The submit button will then return the correct answers to each question. 
 
The last section we have included is a “Recycle Center” tab. In this tab we displayed a few cities with the highest landfill waste problems. Underneath each city, using HTML, we included hyperlinks of recyclable centers in that city. By clicking on the link the user will be led to the company’s website where they can see where the recycling center is located and what they can recycle. 
 
For future development, we plan to use API’s to get and display data about carbon emissions and the cities with the highest landfill problems. 
This project was written using Replit for seamless collaboration, and we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for functionality and improved user interactions. We also created a domain name through GoDaddy Registry.
